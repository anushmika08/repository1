# Visualization
In this project, I analyzed the Data Science Salary Trends (2021–2023) dataset to explore salary patterns across different roles, experience levels, and locations. After performing data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, I deployed various visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These included bar plots, scatter plots, pie charts, line plots, boxplots, and violin plots to uncover trends and outliers in the data. The visualizations provided clear insights into how different factors influenced data science salaries during 2021–2023, supporting informed decision-making and enhancing interpretability of the dataset.
